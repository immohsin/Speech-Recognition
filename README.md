# Speech Recognition Webapp

## Description

The web application uses Speech-To-Text IBM Watson to interpret speech both Streaming and Non-Streaming.
The non-streaming service requires user to upload valid audio file whereas the streaming service uses the browser enabled microphone to interpret speech in real time.
